##  :beginner: About
Implementation of Symbol Table & Hierarchy Checking, based on YAPL Language Specification. Made with Python...

##  :electric_plug: Installation

Just need to install `requirements.txt` dependencies. ANTLR4 compiling steps for lexer/parser generation were omitted, but you can generate them with `make all`.

## :zap: Usage

###  :rocket: Run

```
python3 main.py TEST_FILE
```

If everything it's OK, the Symbol Table may look like the following outputs:

**Hello World**

![hello_world](https://github.com/gusmendez99/compilers/blob/main/images/hello.png?raw=true)

**Fibonacci**

![fibonacci](https://github.com/gusmendez99/compilers/blob/main/images/fibonacci.png?raw=true)


###  :red_circle: Type Checking & Semantic Rules



- [ ] Main
  - [ ] Main Class
  - [ ] Main has `main` func with/o formal params
  - [ ] Main cannot inherit from any other class
  - [ ] Entry point: `(new Main).main()`
- [ ] Basic types
  - [x] Int, String & Bool
  - [ ] They can be used in the definition of classes, creating new derived types from them
  - [ ] Classes that define base types cannot be parents of any other class
- [ ] Scope
  - [x] An attribute within a class must be declared before use
  - [x] A method within a class can be called recursively
  - [x] Global & Local scope
  - [ ] All attributes and methods within a class have public access
  - [ ] Identifiers of a local scope hide the definition of identifiers in the global scope
  - [x] No identifier can be defined more than once within the same scope
  - [x] If B inherits from A and B overrides a method of A, this method must have the same signature with which it was declared in A
  - [x] Multiple inheritance of classes and recursive inheritance is not possible
- [ ] Default values
  - [x] Int: 0
  - [x] String: ""
  - [x] Bool: false
- [ ] Cast
  - [ ] Implicit Bool -> Int allowed
  - [ ] Implicit Int <- Bool not allowed
  - [ ] No explicit cast allowed
- [ ] Assign
  - [x] `<id> <- <expr>`
  - [x] The static type `<expr>` must match the type declared for the `<id>`, or be of a type inherited from type of `<id>`
  - [x] The value of `<expr>` on the right side becomes the value of the <id> object
  - [x] The data type of the assignment is the data type of `<expr>`
  - [x] If the lefthand side of the assignment refers to some class attr, this attribute must be defined within the class.
  - [ ] Both the left and the right sides of the mapping allow identifiers recursive {i.e. `[class1].[class2]....[classn].[attribute]`}
- [ ] Method calls & return values
  - [x] Basic type -> value
  - [x] Derived type -> ref
  - [x] The formal arguments of the method are considered local variables of the method
  - [ ] Arguments are evaluated from left to right
  - [ ] The type of the method's return expression must match the return type declared with the method
  - [x] The value of the return expression will be returned to the calling method and assigned to the left side of an expression
- [x] Control structs
  - [x] The static data type of the `<expr>` used in an if or while control structure must be of type Bool
  - [x] The datatype of the if conditional is the datatype of the block that is a supertype of both branches of the conditional
  - [x] The data type of the while structure is Object
- [ ] Expressions
  - [x] Arith operators applied to Int objects
  - [x] Cmp operators applied to Objects that are of the same static data type or that are Objects of classes inherited from the same class
  - [x] The unary `~` operation applied to the type Int returns a value of type Int
  - [ ] The unary operation not applied to an expression of data type Bool, returns an expression of data type Bool
- [x] Special classes
  - [x] IO
  - [x] IO, Int, String & Bool (with its core methods)
